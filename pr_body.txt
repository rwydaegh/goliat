## Summary

This PR introduces Gaussian excitation support for near-field simulations and includes several core infrastructure improvements.

## Features

### Gaussian Near-Field Support
- Add comprehensive documentation for Gaussian near-field implementation
- Implement ResonanceExtractor for detecting antenna resonance and detuning
- Make excitation type configurable (Harmonic/Gaussian) via config
- Add support for custom Gaussian waveforms (k parameter)
- Update power extraction to handle frequency-domain Gaussian results

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Centralize project save logic and fix ARES connection errors
- Add keep-awake functionality to prevent system sleep during simulations
- Add config file synchronization scripts with CI validation
- Improve cloud setup validation and simulation retry logic
- Fix caching bug where setup_timestamp was overwritten unnecessarily

### Extraction & Analysis
- Refactor tissue grouping with explicit configuration matching
- Improve power extraction and material setup
- Preserve original Sim4Life tissue names

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible. Default excitation type remains Harmonic.
