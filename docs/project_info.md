# Project Information

## About GOLIAT

**GOLIAT (5G expOsure, causaL effects, and rIsk perception through citizen engAgemenT)** is a research project that aims to characterize and monitor RF-EMF exposure, in particular 5G, provide novel insights into potential causal neuropsychological and biological effects, and understand risk perception and communication through citizen engagement using an integrative and transdisciplinary pan-European approach.

The primary objectives of the project include:

-   **Automated Dosimetry**: Creating a Python-based framework to automate simulations using the Sim4Life platform.
-   **Child Phantom Analysis**: Performing simulations on detailed child phantoms, such as "Thelonious" and "Eartha," to understand age-dependent effects.
-   **Comprehensive SAR Analysis**: Calculating Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) metrics, including whole-body, head, trunk, and peak spatial-average SAR (psSAR10g) in sensitive tissues like the skin, eyes, and brain.
-   **Varied Exposure Scenarios**: Investigating numerous exposure conditions, including different frequencies, antenna types, and device positions (e.g., by the cheek, in front of the eyes, near the belly).

## Funding and Acknowledgements

This work is part of the GOLIAT project, which has received funding from the **European Union's Horizon Health program** under the call HORIZON-HEALTH-2021-ENVHLTH-02-01 – Exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) and health.
