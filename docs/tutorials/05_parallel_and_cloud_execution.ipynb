    "- Setup and extract phases can run in parallel (no GPU required)\n",
    "- Run phase (iSolve) cannot run in parallel on a single GPU machine\n",

    "- Speed up setup phases (4x faster)\n",

    "- **NOT speed up run phases** (still sequential, same total time as running individually)\n",

    "1. **oSPARC batch**: Submit simulations to cloud platform where each job gets its own GPU\n",
