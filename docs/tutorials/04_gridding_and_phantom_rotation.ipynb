    "## Scene alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "For by_cheek placements, GOLIAT automatically aligns the entire scene with the phone's upright orientation. This optimizes the computational grid and can reduce simulation time.\n",

    "1. Identifies reference entities on phone:\n",
    "   - PIFA: `component1:Substrate` and `component1:Battery`\n",
    "   - IFA: `Ground` and `Battery`\n",
    "2. Calculates transformation matrix to make phone upright\n",
    "3. Applies transformation to all scene entities:\n",
    "   - Phantom group\n",
    "   - Antenna group\n",
    "   - Simulation bounding box\n",
    "   - Antenna bounding box\n",
    "   - Head and trunk bounding boxes\n",
    "   - Point sensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Only parent groups and bounding boxes are transformed, not individual tissues. This keeps relative geometry correct while aligning the grid with the phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scene alignment](../img/tutorials/tut4_s4l_scene_aligned.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scene after alignment: Phone is upright, grid aligns with phone orientation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "FDTD grids are always axis-aligned rectangular meshes. When the phone is tilted relative to the axes, the grid must use smaller cells to resolve edges accurately. Aligning the phone with the axes lets the grid use larger cells while maintaining accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
