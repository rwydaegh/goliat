    "\n",
    "Learn environmental exposure simulations using plane waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How far-field simulations work (plane waves from different directions)\n",
    "- Reading and understanding config files\n",
    "- Running your first GOLIAT study\n",
    "- Finding and interpreting results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Related documentation**: [User guide (far-field workflow)](../user_guide/user_guide.md#far-field-workflow-environmental-exposure)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required software\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sim4Life 8.2.0**: GOLIAT requires Sim4Life version 8.2.0 with a valid license for the software and the Duke, Ella, Thelonious and Eartha phantoms. Sim4Life is commercial software from [ZMT website](https://zmt.swiss/). Other versions are untested and may not work correctly. Since Sim4Life only runs on Windows, only Windows is supported, although Linux is supported experimentally on Sim4Life web.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git Bash**: GOLIAT commands run in a Bash shell. On Windows, use Git Bash (included with Git for Windows). Other shells may still work though but are not tested and not shown in these tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time using GOLIAT, run these commands from the repository root:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /path/to/goliat\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Add Sim4Life Python to PATH\n",
    "source .bashrc\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Install GOLIAT in editable mode\n",
    "python -m pip install -e .\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Run initialization (downloads models, sets up directories)\n",
    "goliat init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This one-time setup:\n",
    "- Installs Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`\n",
    "- Installs GOLIAT package (makes `goliat` command available)\n",
    "- Downloads phantom models (Duke, Thelonious, Eartha, Ella)\n",
    "- Downloads antenna CAD models\n",
    "- Creates required directories (`data/`, `configs/`, `results/`, `logs/`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The initialization takes 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed. If you accidentally delete parts of this setup, `goliat init` can repair it. A `.setup_done` file is created under `data/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Already initialized?** Just run `source .bashrc` when opening a new terminal, then skip to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed setup instructions, see the [quick start guide](../user_guide/quick_start.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU (recommended)**: GOLIAT uses the FDTD solver (iSolve), which runs much faster on GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver kernel is configured in `base_config.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"solver_settings\": {\n",
    "  \"kernel\": \"acceleware\"  // or \"cuda\" or \"software\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `\"acceleware\"` if you have an AMD or NVIDIA GPU. Use `\"cuda\"` for NVIDIA GPUs only. Use `\"software\"` if you don't have a GPU (much slower).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running commands\n",
    "\n",
    "GOLIAT commands should be run from the repository root directory where you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "goliat/\n",
    "—— configs/          # Configuration files\n",
    "—— data/             # Downloaded models\n",
    "—— goliat/           # Source code\n",
    "—— results/          # Simulation outputs\n",
    "—— logs/             # Log files\n",
    "—— .bashrc           # Shell setup\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All tutorial commands assume you're in this root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the notebook code blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial includes Python code blocks for running commands. These are designed for **Jupyter notebooks** if you prefer that workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running these in VS Code, make sure you set `C:\\Program Files\\Sim4Life_8.2.0.16876\\Python\\python.exe` as your VS Code Python (with `>Python: Select interpreter`) and that you have Jupyter IPython installed.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Understanding far-field exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "Far-field simulations model environmental EMF exposure. The RF source is distant from the person (broadcast antennas, base stations, ambient fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of placing an antenna near the body, we illuminate the phantom with plane waves from different directions. This builds transfer functions that relate measured E-field strength to absorbed power.\n",

    "\n",
    "Plane waves can come from 6 orthogonal directions:\n",
    "- `x_pos`, `x_neg` (front/back)\n",

    "- `z_pos`, `z_neg` (top/bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polarizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each direction, the E-field has two orientations:\n",
    "- `theta` polarization\n",
    "- `phi` polarization\n",

    "- **Whole-body SAR**: Average absorption across entire phantom (here 1.02e-5 mW/kg per 1W input power)\n",
    "- **SAR of groups**: The weighted average SAR for a number of groups (brain, genitals, skin, eyes), which are defined under `data/material_name_mapping.json`\n",
    "- **Peak 10g SAR**: Maximum SAR averaged over 10g tissue cube (as defined in the 62704-1 IEC/IEEE standard), in both the whole body as in the groups\n",
    "- **Power balance**: Energy conservation check (should be close to 100%). Note that the input power comes from a theoretical calculation as Sim4Life does not (yet) support input power of a far-field source.\n",
    "\n",
    "All values are normalized to 1W input power. Scale them based on actual exposure levels.\n",

    "### HTML report\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `sar_stats_all_tissues.html` in a browser. It shows a detailed table of SAR values for every tissue type present in the phantom, the group data, and more details \n",
    "\n",
    "![HTML report](../img/tutorials/tut1_html_report.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps identify which tissues absorb the most energy.\n",

    "### Point sensor convergence plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Each simulation includes a plot showing E-field magnitude over time at monitoring points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Point sensor plot](../img/tutorials/tut1_point_sensor_plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These plots verify that the simulation ran long enough. You should see:\n",
    "- Initial oscillations as fields build up\n",
    "- Gradual decay as steady state is reached\n",
    "- Stable final values (convergence)\n",
    "\n",
    "If fields are still changing rapidly at the end, the simulation may need more time. You can look in the detailed logs to examine if `iSolve` detected convergence for a specific point sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation time\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation time is controlled primarily by the following settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"simulation_parameters\": {\n",
    "  \"global_auto_termination\": \"GlobalAutoTerminationUserDefined\",\n",
    "  \"convergence_level_dB\": -15,\n",
    "  \"simulation_time_multiplier\": 3.5,\n",
    "  \"number_of_point_sensors\": 2\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `global_auto_termination`: As defined in the Sim4Life manual, one can pick how stringent the convergence detection algo is.\n",
    "- `convergence_level_dB`: For user-defined termination, you can control the field decay threshold here.\n",
    "- `simulation_time_multiplier`: This controls the total time the simulation can maximally take. It starts from the theoretical time to cross the bounding box's diagonal at the speed of light in a vacuum, then multiplies this amount by the multiplier.\n",
    "- `number_of_point_sensors`: How many monitoring points to place (default 2). You can control where these are placed with `point_source_order` and pick up to 8 points (for each corner).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sim4Life includes built-in convergence detection that automatically stops simulations when fields reach steady state. This prevents wasting computation time after the solution has converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sim4Life offers several preset termination criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GlobalAutoTerminationNone`: No automatic termination (runs full specified time)\n",
    "- `GlobalAutoTerminationWeak`\n",
    "- `GlobalAutoTerminationMedium`\n",
    "- `GlobalAutoTerminationStrict`\n",
    "- `GlobalAutoTerminationUserDefined`: Custom threshold (what we used)\n",
    "\n",
    "The details can be found in the Sim4Life manual. The field sensor convergence as a whole is taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOLIAT configuration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The base config uses `GlobalAutoTerminationUserDefined` with a -15 dB threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"global_auto_termination\": \"GlobalAutoTerminationUserDefined\",\n",
    "\"convergence_level_dB\": -15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the simulation stops when transient energy decays to 1/1000 (10^(-15/10)) of its initial value, which provides sufficient accuracy for SAR studies.\n",

    "## What you learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Far-field studies use plane waves to model environmental exposure\n",
    "2. Config files control everything (phantoms, frequencies, directions, polarizations)\n",
    "3. GOLIAT automates the entire workflow (setup, run, extract)\n",
    "4. Results are organized by study type, phantom, frequency, and scenario\n",
    "5. SAR metrics quantify absorption (whole-body, localized, peak 10g)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try this\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit `tutorial_1_far_field.json` and:\n",
    "- Add more directions (`y_pos` and `y_neg`)\n",
    "- Add another phantom (`eartha` for adult female)\n",
    "- Add another frequency (`835`)\n",
